1.1.	Project Description
The system we are developing is for the El Paso Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO). The El Paso MPO currently uses Microsoft Access and Microsoft Excel to manage projects, create projects, and generate reports. The El Paso MPO Management System will be web-based. The system will improve the current process by having one workspace in which the users can create, update, and retrieve information on various projects and reports. The system will also allow users to view information on the various projects.
